# Email Scraper

This is a scraping script designed to extract emails from a website.

## Description

It crawls the pages of the input URL and retrieves any emails it discovers. Currently, this is my latest project, and I am still actively working on it. My goal is to develop a Tkinter GUI for the script, as well as incorporate option to test and utilize a proxy server. Additionally, I plan to include a function that allows the user to export the data in various formats.

## Dependencies

* Python 3, requests, BeautifulSoup4, urllib, collections, regex

## Executing/testing the program

* Enter your target website as input
* You may modify line 20 to change the number of crawled pages of the website
* While executing it prints every scaned page
* Finaly it prints collected mails
